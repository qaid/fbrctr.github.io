# Third-party Dependencies

> Including third-party dependencies in your toolkit

Fabricator makes it easy to include a third-party library like [jQuery](http://jquery.com)
in your toolkit.

## Using Webpack to bundle dependencies

Fabricator uses [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io) to bundle modules using the
[CommonJS](http://webpack.github.io/docs/commonjs.html) module syntax:

```javascript
/* src/assets/toolkit/scripts/my-module.js */
module.exports = {
  foo: function() {
    return 'bar';
  }
};
````

```javascript
/* src/assets/toolkit/scripts/toolkit.js */
var myModule = require('./my-module');
myModule.foo(); // 'bar'
```

In the above example, webpack will find all the dependencies and
output a single file that contains both `my-module.js` and `toolkit.js`.

## Dependency Management

It's recommended that you leverage either [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Bower](http://bower.io/search/) to manage dependencies.

### Option 1: NPM

[NPM](http://npmjs.com) is the recommended way to add third-party dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev jquery
```

#### Including NPM dependencies

By default, if a `require()` call is not prefixed with a path, webpack will
recursively search the `node_modules` directories for the specified module.

```javascript
// "./" tells webpack to search the current
// directory for "my-module"
var myModule = require('./my-module');

// no path was specified, so recursively search
// "node_modules" directories for "jquery"
var $ = require('jquery');
$('#my-button').hide();
```

### Option 2: Bower

[Bower](http://bower.io) is a great tool for managing third party client side
dependencies. Here's how to leverage Bower on a Fabricator instance:

1. Install Bower globally for access to the CLI `$ npm install -g bower`
2. Install Bower local to project `$ npm install bower --save-dev`
3. Run `$ bower init` to initialize Bower for your project.
4. Add a `.bowerrc` config file to your project root.

**.bowerrc**

```javascript
{
  "directory": "bower_components"
}
```

5. Update `package.json` `scripts` object to hook into Bower install task.

**package.json**

```javascript
"scripts": {
  "gulp": "gulp",
  "bower": "bower",
  "prestart": "npm install",
  "build": "npm install && gulp",
  "start": "gulp --dev",
  "postinstall": "bower install",
  "test": "npm run build"
},
```

6. Add `bower_components` to `.gitignore`.

7. Install dependencies with Bower.

```bash
$ bower install --save-dev jquery
```


#### Including Bower dependencies

1. Tell webpack to search "bower_components"

**webpack.config.js**

```javascript
// add the "resolve" property to the config
var config = {
  /* other config properties */
  resolve: {
    modulesDirectories: ['node_modules', 'bower_components']
  }
};
```

2. Require the module

Unlike including NPM dependencies, Bower has no rules for how a module
is structured. As a result, you will often have to specify a more specific path:

```javascript
var myLibrary = require('myLibrary/dist/library');
```

## Handling modules that do not use CommonJS

Many Bower modules are just plain JavaScript files that don't use the CommonJS
module syntax; an example might be a jQuery plugin.

Fabricator includes both the [Imports Loader](https://github.com/webpack/imports-loader)
and the [Script Loader](https://github.com/webpack/script-loader) to handle these cases.

### Imports Loader

```javascript
// installed via NPM
var $ = require('jquery');

// installed via Bower
require('imports?$=jquery!somePlugin/dist/plugin');

$('#my-button').somePlugin();
```

### Script Loader

> This loader evaluates code in the global context, just like you would add
the code into a script tag. In this mode every normal library should work.
require, module, etc. are undefined.

> Note: The file is added as string to the bundle. It is not minimized by webpack,
so use a minimized version. There is also no dev tool support for
libraries added by this loader.

```javascript
require('script!anotherLib/lib/another-lib');
```
